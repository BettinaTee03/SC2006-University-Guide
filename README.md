# SG University Guide

## Description
In a world with endless career opportunities and pathways, the process of finding the right university course and a fulfilling career can be overwhelming. Information overload makes it challenging to properly compare choices, and this can lead to inefficient decision making. For students embarking on a new chapter in their lives, this process is long-winded and troublesome, requiring them to invest vast amounts of time and effort.
With this problem in mind, our goal is clear: we aim to streamline the university course and career selection process for prospective students by providing a centralised platform that aggregates essential data from all six local universities. We aim to serve students and education institutions by offering personalised guidance rooted in individual aspirations and preferences. Through this initiative, we aim to help students make smart choices about their education and guide them towards fulfilling careers that are in demand.
