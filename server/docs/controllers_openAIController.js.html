    Given a user's aspiration of {aspiration} and their university course in {course}, identify three unique career prospects that align closely with both. Each career prospect should be tailored to the user's aspiration and not be a generic role commonly associated with the course industry.

    For each career prospect, provide:
    - The name of the career.
    - A progression path from a junior role to a senior role.
    - The top 3 essential skills required for each role in the career path, emphasizing the specific tools, platforms, or methodologies crucial for the role.
    
    Ensure that the suggested careers truly cater to the user's aspirations.
